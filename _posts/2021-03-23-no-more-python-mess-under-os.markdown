As Cloud Engineer I am working with Python and from time to time scripts/apps can require different Python versions or use many different dependencies. This can lead to some mess if I would like to do all those Python things on my OS. But have no fear - this is where virtualenv comes into play. Thanks to that neat tool we can create isolated Python environments for our projects/applications without messing with each project environment. Installation and usage are VERY simple so let's go through it, shall we?

# Installation
This couldnt be easier:
```pip install virtualenv```

# Creating virtualenv and usage
Now we need directory for our virtualenvs, it can be anywhere but i prefer to have one dir with all my virtual environments so in my example:
`mkdir venvs`
`cd venvs`
